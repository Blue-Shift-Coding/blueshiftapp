          <h3 class="color-1">A New Approach To Teaching Technology</h3>
          <p>
            blue{shift} works closely with teachers and schools, providing content and running workshops that help them to achieve the aims of the new National Curriculum in Computing. We set standards by which to teach the new curriculum and provide lesson plans
            and assessment materials.
          </p>
          <div>
          <p>
            We also support schools by bringing new technologies into schools and create lesson plans to enable students to engage with them. We create project-based lesson plans wherein students use code and electronics to realise the products of their imagination.
            Notably:

                We can provide access to computing and robotics products teachers might like to try but are unsure how students might respond

            We work with a range of schools and have taught children as young as 5, all the way up to A-level. Some of the schools and educational bodies we have worked with include Wandsworth Council, Ealing Council, Sussex House, Wetherby School and Knightsbridge
            School. Download a full list of schools.

            We have assessment rubrics for all of our courses so that we can determine our students’ progress. Read more about the new National Curriculum in Computing.

          <h3 class="color-1">After school clubs</h3>
          <p>
            We teach after school clubs to children aged 5 to 14. Our core after school club curriculum is based on both Coding and Robotics, engaging a spectrum of learners through tangible and screen-based exercises. We also have special interest after school clubs such as ‘Animation and Coding’ and ‘Virtual Reality club’.

          <h3 class="color-1">Workshops</h3>
          <p>
            We can come into schools to run a one off workshop or series of workshops. Popular workshops include robotics with Lego Mindstorms, wearables and 3D printing.
