          <p>
            blue{shift} works closely with teachers and schools, providing content and running workshops that help them to achieve the aims of the new National Curriculum in Computing. We set standards by which to teach the new curriculum and provide lesson plans
            and assessment materials.
          </p>
          <div>
          <p>
            We also support schools by bringing new technologies into schools and create lesson plans to enable students to engage with them. We create project-based lesson plans wherein students use code and electronics to realise the products of their imagination.
            Notably:

                We can provide access to computing and robotics products teachers might like to try but are unsure how students might respond

              <li style="list-style-type: disc">
                We can augment computing curriculum in school with creative projects like designing and building games in our after school clubs
